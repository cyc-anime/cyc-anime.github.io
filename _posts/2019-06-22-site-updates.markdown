Long time no see. I've gone through and fixed up some things. Most noticeably, I made a lazy dark theme. It's not perfect but I think it looks better this way. Additionally, I've added a couple more links. There's Nanadato, which is where I make all my posts. You can expect to see more resources to obtain stuff there. And then there's trello, which will keep track of all my progress. This board will show all projects and their status, along with future projects (that I'll probably never get to).

Also, expect a release soon-ish. I'm finally back to working on anime again (but who knows how long that will last). As I mentioned above, you can track my progress on [trello](https://trello.com/b/UVr1TydZ/projects).

That's about it. Happy Summer :)
