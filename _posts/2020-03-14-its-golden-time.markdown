Another day, another release.

Or rather, another month, another release. Kindof...

Anyway, it's here. [Golden Time](/anime/goldentime)'s dub finally came out a few months ago and since then I've been working on this new release. I'm at a point where I'll no longer release something without making inprovements. Or in other words, no more quick muxes. That's a good thing, except for when it comes to time. If I ever do release a quick mux at some point again, it won't be under my main tag. So the majority of my time went to fixing the tsing on all the episodes. It also took some time to sync the english audio.

In other news, I recently released my first encode. A huge thanks to Scyrous for helping me learn the basics and improving my encode script. What show did I encode you ask? Well, a cartoon, Danny Phantom. Why? I picked up the DVD's and there was no good encodes. I've been interested in encoding for awhile now, but there's a lot to it. We'll see if I get around to doing some more encoding or not. You won't find a page for it here, but it's posted over on [nandato](https://nanda.to/topic/4747-cyc-danny-phantom-2003/) if you're interested.

That's it for now. I'll see you in a few months, hopefully.
