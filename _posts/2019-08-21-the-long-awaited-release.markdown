It's finally here folks. That release I mentioned back in June that would be done soon-ish. Kimi to Boku 2 (season 2) can be found added on to the original release page.

There's several reasons for the delays, but the most important one (if that's how you wanna see it) was learning how to use a bunch of scripts/plugins for aegisub. Most of these scripts are made by UA (unanimated) and have tons of different features. He's got his own [github site](https://unanimated.github.io/) that's full of (really hard) to read information. But don't let that stop you, it really has some useful stuff. Check it out if you're in the anime game. Of course the other reasons were the simple lack of motivation, and this game called Satisfactory got me hooked. But enough of that, what's next?

If you look at my [trello board](https://trello.com/b/UVr1TydZ/cryptics-anime-projects), you'll see the Natsume Yuujinchou Movie. It's finally happening folks! I've already started working on it, so expect it soon-ish. Okay maybe not _that_ long since it's just a movie. But I make no promises and won't give any kind of estimation (at least not until I'm nearing completion).

So yeah, see ya in a few months :)
