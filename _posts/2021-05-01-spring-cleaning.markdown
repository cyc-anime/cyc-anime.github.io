Happy May yall. It's been a long time but I'm finally back with another release. Despite the title, no I didn't just happen to do spring cleaning and discover this ready to be relased (if only).

Shounen Maid is a relaxing feel-good show that's a nice watch. This centers around a male maid instead of a female, which is probably why so many ignored it. But it's not about the gender, it's about someone who is obsessed with cleaning and has to move in with an uncle that never cleans. Now yes, for someone to be that into cleaning is rather unrealistic but this is a comedy. Of course I wish I could find that much delight in cleaning things. I say this while looking at all the papers and dust everywhere.

Anyway this release took so long for a few reasons. The sheer number of signs, in depth timing needed, motivation and other projects (like golden time) being prioritized.

Not knowing anything about x265, I mislabeled it as Hi10 instead of Ma10. Though it's not like I even understand why the terminology has to be changed for the same bit depth. But oh well, it's not something I'm going to go back and change unless there's some other issues down the line.

I don't know what I'll work on next, or even when. I think I'll take a break for now though. So yeah, see ya in a few years (probably).
