While I have no news regarding more releases, I have finally decided to put a discord server together. You're probably wondering "why put a discord server together for an inactive muxer?"

Well, with the death of nandato, I no longer have anywhere to post DDL links for those that prefer them. So this discord server is mostly going to be for the DDL links. If you want to chat as well, feel free.

I'll be slowly uploading everything on there so don't expect it all right away. If you happen to spot any issues with my releases, this discord server is the perfect place to report them as I don't check nyaa comments that much.

That's all for now, hopefully the next post will contain a release of some sort.
