It's finally here; The Natsume Yuujinchou movie. It's been added to the [Natsume page](https://cyc-anime.github.io/anime/natsume).

You're probably wondering what took so long. Well tsing was the primary issue I faced. The [chalkboard](https://s.put.re/LXyTboM2.328.png) in the first minute of the video was a tough one. I had to get some help with that. Thanks to shamil11, it looks as good as possible. The chalkboard isn't quite drawn correctly so having the sign look good in that position was very difficult. There was also the [Nanatsujiya](https://s.put.re/YdN2QHeN.460.png) sign that had tough angle due to the bag being bent.

After all of that, I thought I was done. I was in the process of uploading the movie. But then I noticed the [title sign](https://s.put.re/bkWUizDp.557.png) causing some lag. It's not something I noticed while editing, but after doing a quick QC, it was really noticable. This thing would probably fry those operating on toasters. So I stopped the upload and got back to work. It turns out the gradient was too small (the smaller a gradient is the better it looks). I had it at the smallest possible, and after upping it some it still looks really good and doesn't lag. And in turn, the number of lines lessened quite a bit.

Now, it's not as if I spent all this time doing nothing while those delays occoured. I've been working on a couple other projects. One being something new (cartoon related too!). Another being the next project to be released.

I probably won't make another post for awhile so uh, happy holidays.
